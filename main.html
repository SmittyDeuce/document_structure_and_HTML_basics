        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with
                parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter,
                granulated sugar, brown sugar,
                and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda,
                and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet
                ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using)
                until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking
                sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until
                the edges are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the
                baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them
                to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
